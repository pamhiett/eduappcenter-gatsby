# Hack Week 2018: EduAppCenter.com Update

This project is an experiment to rebuild as much of EduAppCenter.com as possible using [Instructure UI](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).
